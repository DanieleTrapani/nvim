My Neovim configuration, using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as a base, and [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the plugin manager.

Plugin list includes:

* [Barbar](https://github.com/romgrk/barbar.nvim) as the tabline
* [Guard](https://github.com/nvimdev/guard.nvim) for LSP configuration, following Null-ls being archived
* [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) for LSP installing and management
* [Netrw](https://github.com/prichrd/netrw.nvim) but better
* [Whichkey](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) for keybindings
* And many more
